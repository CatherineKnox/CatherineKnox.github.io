# About the Product

This pickleball paddle was designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 to meet all 2024 pickleball regulations and incorporate two enhancements. The pickleball paddle was 3D printed on a Voron printer using Polylactic Acid (PLA) for rigidity. The edge guard and grip enhancements are printed using Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) to add flexible components. 

# Regulatory Requirements 

The pickleball paddle complies with regulations listed in the 2024 Pickleball Handbook. It is made of rigid PLA, a non-compressible material, and meets the size constraints. The combined length and width of the paddle is 18.3 inches, which does not exceed the limit of 24 inches. The length of the paddle component is 11 inches, which complies with the limit of 17 inches. 

The pickleball paddle design incorporates a flexible edge guard and TPU grip enhancer, both of which are allowed according to the handbook. Neither modification extends more than 0.5 inches onto the paddle's outer edge, which keeps it within regulation. 

The paddle's surface is smooth and free from delaminations or cracks, which ensures optimal performance. This paddle is designed to be durable and withstand repeated use during pickleball matches, proving it to be a competitive and functional product. The condition of this paddle exceeds the standards outlined in the pickleball handbook. 

# Additional Alterations

The pickleball paddle has two modifications that enhance its functionality. This first is a TPU grip with a chevron extruded pattern on the handle. This is designed to increase friction between the user's hand and the handle. The textured surface provides a secure grip, which increases ease of use. The filleted design of the grip increases ergonomics, which may reduce hand fatigue during long games. 

The second alteration is a removable edge guard, designed to protect the paddle during storage. The flexible guard snaps into place onto the outer edge of the paddle, offering protection against impact and reducing the risk of damage. The edge guard can be easily removed before play. Additionally, its cushioned extrusion of .08 inches offers extra protection if the paddle is dropped, preserving the edge and the face of the paddle. These alterations contribute to a more durable and user-friendly pickleball experience. 

# Weight and Mass Considerations 

The pickleball paddle was designed with careful attention to weight and balance. The paddle alone weighs 7.43 ounces, which is on the lighter side of a mid-weight paddle. This specific weight was chosen to optimize control and maneuverability without compromising power. Additionally, the paddle's center of mass is positioned 0.5 inches above the assembly's centerline, providing better control during gameplay. 

To achieve this center of mass in Fusion 360, an internal infill pattern was created using the extrusion tool. This reduced the top-heavy weight of the paddle and optimized balance. To further reduce paddle weight, a low infill of 7% was implemented. The precise location of the center of mass was calculated using the center of mass locator on Fusion 360, which accounts for all of the assembly's components and materials. 

This design approach ensures that the paddle is lightweight without sacrificing durability. and the position of the center of mass optimizing control of the ball. The balanced paddle is ideal for players of any difficulty seeking paddle solutions with improved maneuverability, power, and a lightweight feel.
