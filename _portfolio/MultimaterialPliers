# Details

* **About This Project** 

Multimaterial pliers incorporate different materials in their construction with different mechanical properties. Using multiple materials in a design can increase functionality, durability and strength, ergonomics, corrosion resistance, and weight reduction. When using multiple materials in 3D printing, print-in-place technology allows one to print multiple parts with different compositions in a single manufacturing process without the need for assembly. This is a great solution for interlocking or jointed components, such as gears or chains. Another beneficial aspect of print-in-place technology is the ability for parts to be fully functional straight off the print bed.

Print-in-place applications extend across various industries, from consumer products to aerospace. A particularly exciting application of print-in-place and multilateral technology is for creating complex medical prosthetics. Multi-material printing allows prosthetics to be custom fitted to the user's specific anatomical measurements, ensuring a comfortable fit. By using print-in-place techniques, prosthetics are designed with integrated joints that adapt to the user's movements.
