**About The Vanderbilt Fusion Project**

The Vanderbilt Fusion Project is an undergraduate-led initiative at Vanderbilt University aimed at designing, building, and testing an Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) Fusion Device. The project involves a multidisciplinary team of students working together to advance nuclear fusion technology and gain practical experience in nuclear engineering, high-voltage systems, vacuum technology, and radiation safety.
