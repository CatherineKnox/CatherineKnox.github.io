# Details

**The Machining Process**

This machinist's hammer was precisely machined from 1018 steel using a lathe, mill, and bandsaw. The process began with the lathe, where the handle was turned down to a specific taper, carefully reducing the diameter along its length to create a comfortable grip. The lathe was also used to create a knurling pattern on the grip section, enhancing texture for improved handling. 

Next, the hammer head was machined on the mill, where the piece was faced to ensure flat, parallel surfaces on both sides. The bandsaw was then used to cut the taper on the head, shaping it for balance and proper function. Finally, threads were cut on both the hammer head and handle, allowing the two components to be securely fastened together for a precise fit. This method ensures durability and precision in the final product.
